    "This notebook includes the even simpler code for generating the \"box-over-box\" data as presented in Figure 1 of our **Part 2.2** paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16293v1). It provides an even simpler math problem set which requires topological sort (just like iGSM) but has maximally removed the surrounding English. As one can see from our Part 2.2 paper, even GPT-4o can fail on such data and cannot correct its own mistakes."
